## Install

## Running Environmant
user need to make sure the running environment and make sure the file path

## New User and Existed User
### Users Inputting
Any new users can input their personal information on the left side bar, including: Name, Gender, Weight, Height, Allergy and Date.
###	Weight Recording Plot and Specific Food Diet Plan
The program will analyze users' healthy condition from the BMI, and showing their Healthy condition and BMI value; the weight change over the time will be 
shown as the plot. The allergy will be taken off from the diet plan and showing the weekly food schedule as final.
### Users Information Writing
In this program, I use the Excel to store the user's information and weight changes. If the user has been inputted the information before, the information has been recorded and he/ she just records the weight per week the plot will showing the changes and showing the current healthy condition.
## Developing Process
In this program, I mainly use the libraries, including streamlit, to visualise the overall code. Pandas is easier to extract the relevant data from these CSV files and index and apply these data. Plotly. express is to plot the final weight change trends and needs less lines showing the result. Datetime and random also are used in the part of my programme. 
## Future work
All users who enter information can compare with the average weight of other users who also use the app.  Because we already have a CSV database.  We can use the comprehensive information as an average in a dot plot for users to compare.
Additionallyï¼Œ in the future, since users can enter unique user names in the current software and can enter no duplicate user names,  unique user id numbers will be a good choice. Generating unique ID numbers can improve this.
